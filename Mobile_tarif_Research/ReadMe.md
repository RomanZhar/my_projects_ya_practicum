# Project Description
It is necessary to analyze the tariffs of **Megaline**, the federal mobile operator. Customers are offered two tariff plans: **"Smart"** and **"Ultra"**.  
To adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which tariff brings in more money.
It is necessary to make a preliminary analysis of tariffs on a small sample of customers.   
We have the data of 500 Megalyne users at our disposal: who they are, where they come from, what tariff they use, how many calls and messages each sent in 2018.  
It is necessary to analyze the behavior of customers and conclude which tariff is better.
