# Real estate market research
We have the data of the Yandex service at our disposal.Real estate - archive of ads for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements for several years. The purpose of the study is to determine the market value of real estate objects. My task is to set the parameters. This will allow you to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.
There are two types of data available for each apartment for sale. The first ones are entered by the user, the second ones are obtained automatically based on cartographic data. For example, the distance to the center, airport, nearest park and reservoir.
